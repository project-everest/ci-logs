Warning 9: : Some globals did not compile to C values and must be initialized before starting main(). You did not provide a main function, so users of your library MUST MAKE SURE they call kremlinit_globals(); (see kremlinit.c). Once you have fixed this, use -warn-error +9 to make this warning non-fatal.

Warning 8: : After inlining, AEAD.Poly1305_64.pad_last (going into AEAD_Poly1305_64) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update (going into Hacl). This is a call across translation units but Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update has a C "inline" qualifier. The C standard allows removing Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_update from its translation unit (see C11 6.7.3 §5), and CompCert will do it.
