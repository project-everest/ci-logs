Warning 9: : Some globals did not compile to C values and must be initialized before starting main(). You did not provide a main function, so users of your library MUST MAKE SURE they call kremlinit_globals(); (see kremlinit.c). Once you have fixed this, use -warn-error +9 to make this warning non-fatal.
