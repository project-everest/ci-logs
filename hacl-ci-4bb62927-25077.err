Warning 13: : Prims.nat, a monomorphic instance, is first used, and therefore inserted, in file Prims which is about to be dropped; you may get a C compiler error about Prims_nat if any other module uses this definition
Warning 14: : C.String.of_literal is not Low*; it uses F*'s Prims.string type and will leak memory; you need to link with a garbage-collector; if this declaration is for specification purposes only, consider marking it noextract or using -bundle <name-of-the-module> to only keep reachable definitions; if you are looking to use C strings, look into C.String (in kremlib/) and Server (in test/).
