Warning 14: : C.String.of_literal is not Low*; it uses F*'s Prims.string type and will leak memory; you need to link with a garbage-collector; if this declaration is for specification purposes only, consider marking it noextract or using -bundle <name-of-the-module> to only keep reachable definitions; if you are looking to use C strings, look into C.String (in kremlib/) and Server (in test/).
