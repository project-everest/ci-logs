C:\build\agent1\_work\16\s\kremlin\_build\src\Kremlin.native: unknown option '-fnouint128'.
KreMLin: from a ML-like subset to C

Usage: C:\build\agent1\_work\16\s\kremlin\_build\src\Kremlin.native [OPTIONS] FILES

High-level description:
1. If some FILES end with .fst or .fsti, and [-verify] is set, KreMLin will
call [fstar] on them to perform verification.
2. If some FILES end with .fst or .fsti, KreMLin will call [fstar] on them to
perform extraction and produce [out.krml].
3. If exactly one FILE ends with [.krml] or [.json], or if a [.krml] file was
produced at step 2., KreMLin will generate a series of [.c] and [.h] files
in the directory specified by [-tmpdir], or in the current directory.
4. If some FILES end with [.c], KreMLin will compile them along with the [.c]
files generated at step 3. to obtain a series of [.o] files.
5. If some FILES end with [.o], [.S] or [.a], KreMLin will link them along with the
[.o] files obtained at step 4. to obtain a final executable.

The [-skip-extraction] option stops KreMLin after step 1.
The [-skip-translation] option stops KreMLin after step 2.
The [-skip-compilation] option stops KreMLin after step 3.
The [-skip-linking] option stops KreMLin after step 4.

The [-warn-error] option follows the OCaml syntax, namely:
- [r] is a range of warnings (either a number [n], or a range [n..n])
- [-r] silences range [r]
- [+r] enables range [r]
- [@r] makes range [r] fatal.

The default is +1..2@3+4..8@9+10@11+12..15 and the available warnings are:
1: not generating code for a provided file
2: found a reference to a function without implementation
3: external command failed
4: type error / malformed input
5: type definition contains an application of an undefined type abbreviation
6: variable-length array
7: private F* function cannot be marked as C static
8: C inline function reference across translation units
9: need to manually call static initializers for globals
10: deprecated feature
11: subexpression is not Low*; cannot proceed
12: cannot be compiled to Wasm
13: monomorphic instance about to be dropped
14: cannot perform tail-call optimization
15: function is not Low*; need compatibility headers

The [-bundle] option takes an argument of the form Api=Pattern1,...,Patternn
The Api= part is optional and Api is made up of a non-empty list of modules
separated by + (for instance: Interface1+Interface2). A pattern is either Foo.Bar
(exact match) or Foo.Baz.* (prefix). The semantics are as follows: all the
modules that match a pattern are grouped into a single C translation unit, and
their declarations are marked as static, inasmuch as cross-translation unit
calls permit. If the Api= part is present, then the module named Api must be
found within the set of input files, and its declarations are appended to the
translation unit without any visibility modifications.

The default arguments are: 

All include directories and paths supports special prefixes:
- if a path starts with FSTAR_LIB, this will expand to wherever F*'s ulib
directory is
- if a path starts with FSTAR_HOME, this will expand to wherever the source
checkout of F* is (this does not always exist, e.g. in the case of an OPAM
setup)

The compiler switches turn on the following options.
[-cc gcc] (default) adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]
[-cc clang] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]
[-cc g++] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses]
[-cc msvc] adds [-warn-error +6 -fnouint128 -falloca]
[-cc compcert] adds [-warn-error @6@8 -fnostruct-passing -fnoanonymous-unions -fnouint128 -ccopts -g,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE]

The [-fc89] option triggers [-fnoanonymous-unions], [-fnocompound-literals] and
[-fc89-scope]. It also changes the invocations above to use [-std=c89]. Note
that if you're using the uint128 type, you will have to manually compile this
code with -DKRML_VERIFIED_UINT128.

To debug Wasm codegen, it might be useful to trigger the same compilation path
as Wasm, but emit C code instead. This can be achieved with [-wasm -d
force-c,c-calls,wasm-calls -drop C,TestLib -add-include '"hack.h"']
where [hack.h] contains [#define WasmSupport_check_buffer_size(X)].

Supported options:
-cc                     compiler to use; one of gcc (default), compcert, g++, clang, msvc

-ccopt                  option to pass to the C compiler and linker (use -ccopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)
-ldopt                  option to pass to the C linker (use -ldopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)

-warn-error             decide which errors are fatal / warnings / silent (default: +1..2@3+4..8@9+10@11+12..15)
