/home/everest/vsts-agent/_work/4/s/kremlin/krml: unknown option '-fnouint128'.
KreMLin: from a ML-like subset to C

Usage: /home/everest/vsts-agent/_work/4/s/kremlin/krml [OPTIONS] FILES

High-level description:
1. If some FILES end with .fst or .fsti, and [-verify] is set, KreMLin will
call [fstar] on them to perform verification.
2. If some FILES end with .fst or .fsti, KreMLin will call [fstar] on them to
perform extraction and produce [out.krml].
3. If exactly one FILE ends with [.krml] or [.json], or if a [.krml] file was
produced at step 2., KreMLin will generate a series of [.c] and [.h] files
in the directory specified by [-tmpdir], or in the current directory.
4. If some FILES end with [.c], KreMLin will compile them along with the [.c]
files generated at step 3. to obtain a series of [.o] files.
5. If some FILES end with [.o], [.S] or [.a], KreMLin will link them along with the
[.o] files obtained at step 4. to obtain a final executable.

The [-skip-extraction] option stops KreMLin after step 1.
The [-skip-translation] option stops KreMLin after step 2.
The [-skip-compilation] option stops KreMLin after step 3.
The [-skip-linking] option stops KreMLin after step 4.

The [-warn-error] option follows the OCaml syntax, namely:
- [r] is a range of warnings (either a number [n], or a range [n..n])
- [-r] silences range [r]
- [+r] enables range [r]
- [@r] makes range [r] fatal.

The default is +1..2@3+4..8@9+10@11+12..15 and the available warnings are:
1: not generating code for a provided file
2: found a reference to a function without implementation
3: external command failed
4: type error / malformed input
5: type definition contains an application of an undefined type abbreviation
6: variable-length array
7: private F* function cannot be marked as C static
8: C inline function reference across translation units
9: need to manually call static initializers for globals
10: deprecated feature
11: subexpression is not Low*; cannot proceed
12: cannot be compiled to Wasm
13: monomorphic instance about to be dropped
14: cannot perform tail-call optimization
15: function is not Low*; need compatibility headers

The [-bundle] option takes an argument of the form Api=Pattern1,...,Patternn
The Api= part is optional and Api is made up of a non-empty list of modules
separated by + (for instance: Interface1+Interface2). A pattern is either Foo.Bar
(exact match) or Foo.Baz.* (prefix). The semantics are as follows: all the
modules that match a pattern are grouped into a single C translation unit, and
their declarations are marked as static, inasmuch as cross-translation unit
calls permit. If the Api= part is present, then the module named Api must be
found within the set of input files, and its declarations are appended to the
translation unit without any visibility modifications.

The default arguments are:

All include directories and paths supports special prefixes:
- if a path starts with FSTAR_LIB, this will expand to wherever F*'s ulib
directory is
- if a path starts with FSTAR_HOME, this will expand to wherever the source
checkout of F* is (this does not always exist, e.g. in the case of an OPAM
setup)

The compiler switches turn on the following options.
[-cc gcc] (default) adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]
[-cc clang] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]
[-cc g++] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-Wno-parentheses]
[-cc msvc] adds [-warn-error +6 -fnouint128 -falloca]
[-cc compcert] adds [-warn-error @6@8 -fnostruct-passing -fnoanonymous-unions -fnouint128 -ccopts -g,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE]

The [-fc89] option triggers [-fnoanonymous-unions], [-fnocompound-literals] and
[-fc89-scope]. It also changes the invocations above to use [-std=c89]. Note
that if you're using the uint128 type, you will have to manually compile this
code with -DKRML_VERIFIED_UINT128.

To debug Wasm codegen, it might be useful to trigger the same compilation path
as Wasm, but emit C code instead. This can be achieved with [-wasm -d
force-c,c-calls,wasm-calls -drop C,TestLib -add-include '"hack.h"']
where [hack.h] contains [#define WasmSupport_check_buffer_size(X)].

Supported options:
-cc                     compiler to use; one of gcc (default), compcert, g++, clang, msvc
-m32                    turn on 32-bit cross-compiling
-fsopt                  option to pass to F* (use -fsopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)
-ccopt                  option to pass to the C compiler and linker (use -ccopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)
-ldopt                  option to pass to the C linker (use -ldopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)
-skip-extraction        stop after step 1.
-skip-translation       stop after step 2.
-skip-compilation       stop after step 3.
-skip-linking           stop after step 4.
-verify                 ask F* to verify the program
-verbose                show the output of intermediary tools when acting as a driver for F* or the C compiler
-diagnostics list       recursive functions and overly nested data types (useful for MSVC)
-wasm                   emit a .wasm file instead of C

-add-early-include      prepend #include the-argument to every generated file, before kremlib.h
-add-include            prepend #include the-argument to every generated file, after the #define __FOO_H
-add-include-tmh        append #include <FILE.tmh>, where FILE is the current basename
-minimal                do not prepend #include "kremlib.h"; do not bundle FStar
-static-header          generate a .h for the given module where all functions are marked a static inline
-no-prefix              don't prepend the module name to declarations from this module
-bundle                 group modules into a single C translation unit (see above)
-drop                   do not extract Code for this module (see above)
-header                 prepend the contents of the given file at the beginning of each .c and .h
-tmpdir                 temporary directory for .out, .c, .h and .o files
-I                      add directory to search path (F* and C compiler)
-o                      name of the resulting executable
-warn-error             decide which errors are fatal / warnings / silent (default: +1..2@3+4..8@9+10@11+12..15)

-by-ref                 pass the given struct type by reference, always
-falloca                use alloca(3) for variable-length arrays on the stack
-fnostruct-passing      disable passing structures by value and use pointers instead
-fnoanonymous-unions    disable C11 anonymous unions
-fnocompound-literals   don't generate C11 compound literals
-ftail-calls            statically compile tail-calls into loops
-funroll-loops          textually expand loops smaller than N
-fparentheses           add unnecessary parentheses to silence GCC and Clang's -Wparentheses
-fno-shadow             add unnecessary renamings to defeat GCC and Clang's -Wshadow, as well as the various MSVC warnings
-fcurly-braces          always add curly braces around blocks
-fnoshort-enums         use C11 enums instead of C macros and uint8_t for enums
-fc89-scope             use C89 scoping rules
-fc89                   generate C89-compatible code (meta-option, see above)

-dpattern               pretty-print after pattern matches compilation
-dsimplify              pretty-print the internal AST after going to a statement language
-dstructs               pretty-print the internal AST after struct transformations
-dc                     pretty-print the output C
