dos2unix: converting file parser/parse.fsi to Unix format...
Warning: you are using the standard library and/or the %inline keyword. We
recommend switching on --infer in order to avoid obscure type error messages.
warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in src/parser/parse.fsy.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
