This is a call across translation units but Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block has a C "inline" qualifier. The C standard allows removing Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_process_last_block from its translation unit (see C11 6.7.3 §5), and CompCert will do it. 
Warning 7: : After inlining, AEAD.Poly1305_64.poly1305_blocks_finish (going into AEAD_Poly1305_64) calls Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_last_pass (going into Hacl_Chacha20) -- removing the static qualifier from Hacl.Impl.Poly1305_64.poly1305_last_pass

Warning 13: : Prims.nat, a monomorphic instance, is first used, and therefore inserted, in file Prims which is about to be dropped; you may get a C compiler error about Prims_nat if any other module uses this definition
Warning 14: : C.String.of_literal is not Low*; it uses F*'s Prims.string type and will leak memory; you need to link with a garbage-collector; if this declaration is for specification purposes only, consider marking it noextract or using -bundle <name-of-the-module> to only keep reachable definitions; if you are looking to use C strings, look into C.String (in kremlib/) and Server (in test/). See the KreMLin tutorial for more information.
Warning 10: : -drop is deprecated
use a combination of -bundle and -d reachability to make sure the functions are eliminated as you wish
