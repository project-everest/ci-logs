A pattern is either Foo.Bar\n(exact match) or Foo.Baz.* (prefix). The semantics are as follows: all the\nmodules that match a pattern are grouped into a single C translation unit, and\ntheir declarations are marked as static, inasmuch as cross-translation unit\ncalls permit. If the Api= part is present, then the module named Api must be\nfound within the set of input files, and its declarations are appended to the\ntranslation unit without any visibility modifications.\n\nThe default arguments are: \n\nAll include directories and paths supports special prefixes:\n  - if a path starts with FSTAR_LIB, this will expand to wherever F*'s ulib\n    directory is\n  - if a path starts with FSTAR_HOME, this will expand to wherever the source\n    checkout of F* is (this does not always exist, e.g. in the case of an OPAM\n    setup)\n\nThe compiler switches turn on the following options.\n  [-cc gcc] (default) adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]\n  [-cc clang] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]\n  [-cc g++] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses]\n  [-cc msvc] adds [-warn-error +6 -fnouint128 -falloca]\n  [-cc compcert] adds [-warn-error @6@8 -fnostruct-passing -fnoanonymous-unions -fnouint128 -ccopts -g,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE]\n\nThe [-fc89] option triggers [-fnoanonymous-unions], [-fnocompound-literals] and\n[-fc89-scope]. It also changes the invocations above to use [-std=c89]. Note\nthat if you're using the uint128 type, you will have to manually compile this\ncode with -DKRML_VERIFIED_UINT128.\n\nTo debug Wasm codegen, it might be useful to trigger the same compilation path\nas Wasm, but emit C code instead. This can be achieved with [-wasm -d\nforce-c,c-calls,wasm-calls -drop C,TestLib -add-include '\"hack.h\"']\nwhere [hack.h] contains [#define WasmSupport_check_buffer_size(X)].\n\nSupported options:\n  -cc                     compiler to use; one of gcc (default), compcert, g++, clang, msvc\n  -m32                    turn on 32-bit cross-compiling\n  -fsopt                  option to pass to F* (use -fsopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)\n  -ccopt                  option to pass to the C compiler and linker (use -ccopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)\n  -ldopt                  option to pass to the C linker (use -ldopts to pass a comma-separated list of values)\n  -skip-extraction        stop after step 1.\n  -skip-translation       stop after step 2.\n  -skip-compilation       stop after step 3.\n  -skip-linking           stop after step 4.\n  -verify                 ask F* to verify the program\n  -verbose                show the output of intermediary tools when acting as a driver for F* or the C compiler\n  -diagnostics list       recursive functions and overly nested data types (useful for MSVC)\n  -wasm                   emit a .wasm file instead of C\n                          \n  -add-early-include      prepend #include the-argument to every generated file, before kremlib.h\n  -add-include            prepend #include the-argument to every generated file, after the #define __FOO_H\n  -add-include-tmh        append #include <FILE.tmh>, where FILE is the current basename\n  -minimal                do not prepend #include \"kremlib.h\"; do not bundle FStar\n  -static-header          generate a .h for the given module where all functions are marked a static inline\n  -no-prefix              don't prepend the module name to declarations from this module\n  -bundle                 group modules into a single C translation unit (see above)\n  -drop                   do not extract code for this module (see above)\n  -library                this is a model and all functions should be made abstract\n  -header                 prepend the contents of the given file at the beginning of each .c and .h\n  -tmpdir                 temporary directory for .out, .c, .h and .o files\n  -I                      add directory to search path (F* and C compiler)\n  -o                      name of the resulting executable\n  -warn-error             decide which errors are fatal / warnings / silent (default: +1..2@3+4..8@9+10@11+12..15)\n                          \n  -by-ref                 pass the given struct type by reference, always\n  -falloca                use alloca(3) for variable-length arrays on the stack\n  -fnostruct-passing      disable passing structures by value and use pointers instead\n  -fnoanonymous-unions    disable C11 anonymous unions\n  -fnocompound-literals   don't generate C11 compound literals\n  -ftail-calls            statically compile tail-calls into loops\n  -funroll-loops          textually expand loops smaller than N\n  -fparentheses           add unnecessary parentheses to silence GCC and Clang's -Wparentheses\n  -fno-shadow             add unnecessary renamings to defeat GCC and Clang's -Wshadow, as well as the various MSVC warnings\n  -fcurly-braces          always add curly braces around blocks\n  -fnoshort-enums         use C11 enums instead of C macros and uint8_t for enums\n  -fc89-scope             use C89 scoping rules\n  -fc89                   generate C89-compatible code (meta-option, see above)\n                          \n  -djson                  dump the input AST as JSON\n  -dast                   pretty-print the internal AST\n  -dmonomorphization      pretty-print the internal AST after monomorphization\n  -dinline                pretty-print the internal AST after inlining\n  -dpattern               pretty-print after pattern matches compilation\n  -dsimplify              pretty-print the internal AST after going to a statement language\n  -dstructs               pretty-print the internal AST after struct transformations\n  -dc                     pretty-print the output C\n  -dwasm                  pretty-print the output Wasm\n  -d                      debug the specific comma-separated list of values; currently supported: inline,bundle,reachability,c-calls,wasm-calls,wasm-memory,wasm,force-c,cflat\n                          \n  -help                   Display this list of options\n  --help                  Display this list of options\n")
