A pattern is either Foo.Bar\n(exact match) or Foo.Baz.* (prefix). The semantics are as follows: all the\nmodules that match a pattern are grouped into a single C translation unit, and\ntheir declarations are marked as static, inasmuch as cross-translation unit\ncalls permit. If the Api= part is present, then the module named Api must be\nfound within the set of input files, and its declarations are appended to the\ntranslation unit without any visibility modifications.\n\nThe default arguments are: \n\nAll include directories and paths supports special prefixes:\n  - if a path starts with FSTAR_LIB, this will expand to wherever F*'s ulib\n    directory is\n  - if a path starts with FSTAR_HOME, this will expand to wherever the source\n    checkout of F* is (this does not always exist, e.g. in the case of an OPAM\n    setup)\n\nThe compiler switches turn on the following options.\n  [-cc gcc] (default) adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]\n  [-cc clang] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses -ccopt -std=c11]\n  [-cc g++] adds [-ccopts -Wall,-Werror,-Wno-unused-variable,-Wno-unknown-warning-option,-Wno-unused-but-set-variable,-g,-fwrapv,-fstack-check,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE,-D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO,-Wno-parentheses]\n  [-cc msvc] adds [-warn-error +6 -fnouint128 -falloca]\n  [-cc compcert] adds [-warn-error @6@8 -fnostruct-passing -fnoanonymous-unions -fnouint128 -ccopts -g,-D_BSD_SOURCE,-D_DEFAULT_SOURCE]\n\nThe [-fc89] option triggers [-fnoanonymous-unions], [-fnocompound-literals] and\n[-fc89-scope]. It also changes the invocations above to use [-std=c89].
